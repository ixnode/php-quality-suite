üöÄ **Zero-config. Out-of-the-box. Instant code quality.**  

The PHP Quality Suite combines [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector), [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan), and [PHPMD](https://phpmd.org/) into a single developer-friendly toolbox.

Run static analysis and automated refactorings with simple CLI commands ‚Äì no configuration required. Just:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-quality-suite rector --level=0 --dry-run
```

‚úîÔ∏è No setup needed ‚Äì works immediately after installation<br>
‚úîÔ∏è Instant upgrades ‚Äì migrate between PHP or Symfony versions<br>
‚úîÔ∏è Quality built-in ‚Äì type safety, dead code removal, coding standards

## 1. Installation

```bash
composer require --dev ixnode/php-quality-suite
```

```bash
vendor/bin/php-quality-suite -V
```

```bash
php-quality-suite 0.1.0 (2025-09-20 19:59:14) - Bj√∂rn Hempel <bjoern@hempel.li>
```

## 2. Quick start

Make sure your `composer.json` defines the target PHP version for analysis, e.g.:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.0"
    }
}
```

Analyze your codebase right away:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-quality-suite rector --include=src --level=0 --dry-run
```

‚úÖ Runs instantly<br>
‚úÖ No setup required<br>
‚úÖ Safe first checks without modifying files

Remove `--dry-run` once you‚Äôre ready to apply the fixes automatically.

> **Hint**: By default, this example uses the src directory. For customizing paths or excluding directories, see
> the following chapter **Preparation**.

## 3. Preparation

### PHP Version

The static analysis tools determine the target PHP version from your project's `composer.json`.

Make sure your `composer.json` contains the desired PHP version in the `require.php` field,
for example:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.0"
    }
}
```

This setting defines the PHP version Rector and PHPStan will use for parsing and refactoring.
Adjust this value according to the PHP version you want to migrate to or validate against.

### Paths

The **PHP Quality Suite** needs to know which paths to analyze and which ones to ignore.

A template configuration file is included in this package:

```bash
cp vendor/ixnode/php-quality-suite/config/pqs.yml.dist pqs.yaml
```

Now adjust the file `pqs.yaml` to match your project structure.

#### Example `pqs.yaml`

```yaml
paths-included:
  src: src
  tests: tests
  vendor_gui: lib/VendorGuiBundle

paths-excluded:
  - src/Legacy
  - src/Experimental
```

* `paths-included`: Directories or files to be analyzed. You can assign keys (e.g. `vendor_gui`) to reference them in CLI commands.
* `paths-excluded`: Directories or files that are always excluded from analysis. These paths are passed to Rector automatically.

#### Notes

* All paths are relative to the project root.
* You can include both directories and single files.
* If `pqs.yaml` is missing, the default configuration `pqs.yaml.dist` from the package will be used.

#### Usage with `--include`

By default, all paths listed under paths are analyzed. You can restrict the analysis to specific entries using the
`--include` option: `--include=src,vendor_gui`. This will analyze only the `src` and `vendor_gui` directories, while
the excluded paths from `pqs.yaml` are always respected.
