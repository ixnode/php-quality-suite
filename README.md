> PHP Quality Suite - A zero-config PHP quality toolbox combining Rector, PHPStan, and PHPMD. Run static analysis and automated refactorings with simple commands.

## 1. Installation

```bash
composer require --dev ixnode/php-quality-suite
```

```bash
vendor/bin/php-quality-suite -V
```

```bash
php-quality-suite 0.1.0 (2025-09-20 19:59:14) - Bj√∂rn Hempel <bjoern@hempel.li>
```

## 2. Quick start

### PHP Version

The static analysis tools determine the target PHP version from your project's `composer.json`.

Make sure your `composer.json` contains the desired PHP version in the `require.php` field,
for example:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.0"
    }
}
```

This setting defines the PHP version Rector and PHPStan will use for parsing and refactoring.
Adjust this value according to the PHP version you want to migrate to or validate against.

```bash
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.0"
    }
}
```

### Paths

The **PHP Quality Suite** needs to know which paths to analyze and which ones to ignore.

A template configuration file is included in this package:

```bash
cp vendor/ixnode/php-quality-suite/paths.yaml.dist paths.yaml
```

Now adjust the file paths.yaml to your project structure.

```yaml
paths:
  src: src
  tests: tests

excluded:
  - src/Legacy
  - src/Experimental
```

* `paths`: List of directories or files that should be analyzed. Use key-value pairs to give them descriptive names if you like.
* `excluded`: List of paths to be excluded from analysis.

#### Notes

* All paths are relative to the project root.
* You can include both directories and single files.

### First check

To run your first analysis, use:

```Bash
vendor/bin/php-quality-suite analyze --include=src --level=0 --dry-run
```

| Argument        | Description                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `--include=src` | Limits the analysis to the src directory.                |
| `--level=0`     | Runs only the most critical checks (safe to start with). | 
| `--dry-run`     | Shows the suggested changes without modifying any files. |

This will give you an overview of potential issues in your codebase without applying any changes yet.
